What does it really mean to be a mentee? Does this mean you have to meet with your mentor consistently? What kind of questions can you ask your mentor? These tips and suggestions are here to assure you of any stress you may have in a mentorship. You don't need to take **all** of these suggestions, but instead, they should help you figure out what you may want from your mentorship to meet your goals in school and in tech.

##### \*CS = Computer Science
##### \*UI/UX = User Interface/User Experience

### tl;dr
* Be yourself; you don't have to prove yourself to your mentor or anyone else.
* Be honest and don't hold back or assume anything. You will benefit the most from your mentorship if you ask those "dumb" questions.
* Get ready to be proactive! This is also an opportunity to practice consistent communication. More tips on this down below.

### General
* Think about what you hope to gain from this mentorship. You might be able to think about some clear needs from your mentor, but if you don't know where to start, begin by asking questions you have about CS. 
* Here're some general topics you can ask your mentor
	* Professor/Classes to take
	* Getting involved with tech outside of school
		* Open Source Development
		* Conferences, workshops, and community events
		* Community service, teaching code, public outreach events
	* Ways to become better at programming, problem solving, finishing projects
	* How to find internships, acing those interviews, connecting with companies
	* Doing research on/off campus
	* Exploring subfields in computer science (e.g. UX/UI Design, Security, Web Development, Embedded Engineering)
* Try your best to find someone who can relate to.
* Once you found a mentor you connect with, the best thing you can do is to stay in consistent contact with them. Whether it's meeting once a week, once a month, or catching up at least once a semester, you are able to reflect on your mentor and your own growth over time.

### Meeting Up
* **Before you meet with your mentor**, send an introduction to them. This could simply be sending dates for a coffee chat or a blurb of what you hope to learn from them. It greatly helps to send a couple questions you may already have so when you do meetup, your mentor has an idea of what you may need advice in. 
* **During your meetup**, it's helpful to have some ideas (even better, questions) of what you want to discuss with your mentor. If you have a list of questions, don't worry about trying to cover everything you wanted to in the inital meeting. 
* No one is perfect, and most times, your mentor will not be able to answer all of your questions.
	* Even if your mentor's interest do not align with yours, you can still learn a lot from their experience in school and in the tech community. Align your questions to how your mentor can help you:

Here's an example: You're deciding on attending graduate school and you're mentor has no reesearch experience but has done multiple internships. Ask your mentor about whether they have had to make the same decision and whether their colleagues has pursued grad schools.

* Although you are a mentee, be sure to understand their goals as well. 
	* Ask if they plan to stay in their current path/role when they graduate
	* If they've done an internship or research in the past, ask how that change their perspective on continuing that role after college
* Though you can ask your mentor about anything in CS, it is more worthwhile to ask for your mentor's opinion. You can find many answers to the question online (and in the resource tab!), but finding opinions on how to navigate the start of your career path is valuable. This is also a great time to ask your mentor to review your resume.
* Remember to always exchange emails, Twitter handle, or any other contact information at the end. Even if you didn't feel any connection with your mentor, they can still serve as a point of reference to you at your college and in your career.
* **After your meeting**, send an email of thanks and any follow up questions. No matter if it's a few hours after your meeting or a few weeks. However, the sooner, the better :)
