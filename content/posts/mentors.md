One of the best ways to help someone is to share your experience with them. Whether you've had your own mentor before or you're doing this for the first time, it goes a long way to help someone navigate their college experience and the start of their career. Even though your role as a mentor is to advise your mentee(s), you can also reflect on your mentee(s)' experience and learn from them!

### tl;dr
* You don't need to know all the answers. Connect them with people who may know the answer
* Be reflective and specific about your advices. Think about how your advice can be actionable on their part
* Mentees can often feel guilty for either taking up your time or for not keeping in better touch with you. A simple email or message asking them about their classes can go a long way

#### General
* Listen. It's the best thing you can do as a mentor.
* It's common for mentees to be intimidated to ask for help in tech. A great way to show that part of being a good in tech is knowing how to help.

A great way to do this is debugging a problem in front of your mentees. This can be debugging buggy code or gooogling one of their questions with them.

* Be courteous and don't share the information with others unless implied
* Don't make assumptions on what they know or don't know.

Tech is also one of those fields that has many acronyms and buzzwords. Before going into a topic, ask your mentee if they know the term. Find a balance in gauging your mentee's knowledge and showing enthusisam in your explanation can make the topic less intimidating.

* Be concious about abstracting topics. First, give an overview, break it down into components, zoom back out, and explain how each component works again.
* Get ready to also learn from your mentee!

#### Meeting Up
* Reach out first. Mentees can feel intimidated or feel guilty for taking up your time.
	* Let them know it's okay to ask different questions. If you specialize in something, encourage them to take advantage this mentorship.
	* Ask them if they have any goals this sesmeter. It also helps to have them send you some of their questions before your first meeting. Not only will you have more time to answer their questions, but it will help them think about how you can help them.
	* Establish what's the best way to reach each other (e.g. Email, message, Facebook, Slack, etc.).

Be transparent about being *ghosted*. Many mentees get intimidated when they don't keep connected, and as a result, they think you're not interested. Letting them know that it's okay to be disconnected, and sending you an email months later is better than never letting you know at all.

* **During your meeting with your mentee**, be open about your accomplishments and your **failures and insecurities**. You want to help your mentee build confidence in their studies and in their skillset.
	* General things that you can do during your meeting could be talking about getting internships/jobs, classes, reviewing resumes.
	* Especially in college, it's good to discuss things outside of the formal mentorship. Personal discussions can help build trust
	* Setting goals in the mentorship can help keep account of each other's roles. For mentees, this could be setting up a GitHub account or having a list of internships ready before your next meeting. For mentors, your goals can be looking for specific projects or events that aligns with your mentee's interest.
	* Get to know their personalities. It's just as important as their experience and it's part of their identity. With care, you can ultimately help build up their confidence!
	* Discuss the next possible meeting. A mentorship is no fun when it feels like a long-term commitment. Set a soft meeting date.
	* Being reflective can help validate some of the mentees assumptions and actions. 
* Mentees often struggle with following-up with emails. If after a few days you do not hear anything from your mentee, reach out with an email. Again, mentees can often feel intimidated.
* Some of us are taking five classes, working 20 hours a week, and don't have time to consistently meet with our mentee. That is fine! Sending an email to follow up about their goals can go far. If you think your mentee will benefit more from consistent meetings, you may want to look for someone who can support them that way.
* An informal way of staying in touch with your mentee could be forwarding articles or internship opportunities to your mentee.
