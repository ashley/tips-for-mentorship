This guide was build from the advice and suggestions from women in tech. As part of NYU's WinC's (Women in Computing) Mentorship Program, I received feedback from students who have been mentees and mentors themselves, members of [Ladies Storm Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LadiesStormHackathons/) and other women working in the tech industry as engineers, researchers, designers, managers, and recruiters. If you have something to add, you can contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/msashleychen).
